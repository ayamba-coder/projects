# projects

My story journey as a Front-End developer begins from here. This would lead you to all the personal projects i have done as i started up the stack.

-irresponsive websites to the point of responsiveness
- From zero javascript experience to reasonable skill in javascript.
- From alot of bad coding practices to a better style

  Talk is cheap? :), then i invite you to take a look at them one by one.
  Project structuring based on expertize is random.
  
gateway to all my personal projects
